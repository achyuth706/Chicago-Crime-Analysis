# Chicago Crime Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes crime trends in the city of Chicago using publicly available crime data. The goal is to uncover patterns in crime based on day, time, location, and type. The final outputs are **interactive Power BI dashboards** that visually represent crime trends and arrest rates.

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Chicago has faced persistent crime issues, and understanding crime trends can help in law enforcement and policymaking. This project aims to answer key questions such as:
- When do crimes most frequently occur?
- What are the most common types of crimes?
- How do arrest rates vary by crime type?
- How have crime patterns changed over time?

## 🎯 Key Findings
- **Peak Crime Times**: Late-night and early morning hours on weekends witness the highest crime rates.
- **Most Common Crimes**: Theft, battery, and criminal damage are the top three crime types.
- **Geographical Trends**: Certain areas in Chicago experience significantly higher crime rates.
- **Arrest Patterns**: Narcotics-related crimes have a higher arrest rate compared to theft and battery.

## 📊 Dashboards
We created **three Power BI dashboards** to visualize crime trends effectively:
1. **Time-based Analysis**: Crime frequency by time of day and day of the week.
2. **Crime Type Distribution**: Top crime categories and arrest vs. non-arrest ratios.
3. **Geographical Mapping**: Crime hotspots based on location data.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the [City of Chicago Open Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/). The primary dataset, **"Crimes - 2001 to Present"**, contains details such as crime type, location, arrest status, and timestamps.

## 🏗️ Steps Taken
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, formatted timestamps, and removed redundant fields.
2. **Data Integration**: Merged crime data with police district and community area datasets for better geographical analysis.
3. **Visualization**: Developed heatmaps, donut charts, and geographic maps to illustrate crime patterns.
4. **Feedback & Improvement**: Incorporated suggestions from the client to enhance visual appeal and clarity.

## 🎯 Intended Audience
This project is beneficial for:
- **Law Enforcement Agencies**: Allocate resources based on crime trends.
- **Residents & Neighborhood Associations**: Improve community safety awareness.
- **Policymakers & City Officials**: Make data-driven decisions for crime prevention.
- **Community Organizations**: Advocate for safer neighborhoods.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)**: Data preprocessing and analysis.
- **SQL**: Querying and filtering data for meaningful insights.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Mapping crime locations to identify hotspots.
